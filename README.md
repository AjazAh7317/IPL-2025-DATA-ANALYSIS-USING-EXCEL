# IPL-2025-DATA-ANALYSIS-USING-EXCEL

This project is a detailed data analysis of the IPL 2025 season, completed entirely using Microsoft Excel. It covers match-level, ball-level, and player-specific performance insights using data from four key datasets: matches, deliveries, Orange Cap (top run-scorers), and Purple Cap (top wicket-takers).

What I Did:

Using Complete_matches(1).csv:
Analyzed how winning the toss influenced match outcomes.
Broke down “Player of the Match” trends.
Studied match patterns by date and playoff stages.
Compared team-wise batting performances.
Summarized match results across the season.

Using deliveries.csv:
Counted dot balls bowled by each bowler.
Analyzed boundary-hitting (4s and 6s) by batsmen.
Tracked wickets by each bowler.
Conducted powerplay (overs 1–6) and death-over (overs 17–20) analysis.
Evaluated boundary contributions by team.

Using orange_cap.csv:
Compared top batsmen on runs, strike rate, and consistency.
Created visuals comparing averages and boundary counts.
Tracked performance over innings.

Using purple_cap.csv:
Identified the most effective bowlers of the season.
Analyzed economy rate vs. wickets taken.
Compared bowling averages and strike rates.

📊 Visuals and Dashboards:
Each section of the analysis is presented through pivot tables and Excel charts (bar, line, radar, etc.). Dashboards were designed to be clean, easy to read, and visually explain the key takeaways. A snapshot of one of these dashboards is also included (Dashboard.png).

🛠 Tools & Techniques Used:
Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Slicers, Filters)
Basic Excel formulas for calculated metrics
Dashboard design for storytelling with data

🎯 Project Purpose:
This project was built as a portfolio piece to demonstrate strong foundational skills in Excel for data analysis. It serves as a stepping stone toward more advanced tools such as Power BI, SQL, and Python, and focuses not just on the analysis itself, but on clear and insightful presentation.

🔄 What’s Next:
The next phase of the project will involve replicating and expanding this analysis using Power BI for interactive dashboards, SQL for deeper data querying, and Python for automation and advanced analytic
